# diaaaooo.github.io

This is an old-fashioned blog run by a quiet and often boring brain. 🐶

## How to
Create a new post.
```
hugo new --kind post content/posts/example/example.md
```

Start Hugo’s development server to view the site with drafts.
```
hugo server -D
```

Publish the site.
```
- Merge to main branch
```

## Casual update
1. Just put down questions and quick thoughts
2. Research on those questions and find the answers
3. Complete the post and release it
4. Ideally, weekly update at least
