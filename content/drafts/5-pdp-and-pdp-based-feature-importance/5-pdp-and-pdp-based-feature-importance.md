## Questions
- How does the math work? Explain it with examples
- PDP vs. feature-target plot during EDA, what's difference? Shouldn't EDA capture the relationship? Compare PDP plot and feature-target plot to see how well the model capture the relationship?
- What calculation methods do popular libraries use?
- Regression vs. Classification, numerical vs. categorical. How does it work?
- PDP and PDP-based feature importance

## A Little Bit History
A little bit history on PDP...
PDP plot is proposed in 2001, for what reason? for what use?
PDP-based feature importance is proposed in 2017?
